excerpt: 'This paper studies non-convex optimization problems where the data is distributed across nodes of a time-varying directed network; this describes dynamic settings in which the communication between network nodes is affected by delays or link failures. The network nodes, which can access only their local objectives and query a stochastic first-order oracle for the gradient estimates, collaborate by exchanging messages with their neighbors to minimize a global objective function. We propose an algorithm for non-convex optimization problems in such settings that leverages stochastic gradient descent with momentum and gradient tracking..'
