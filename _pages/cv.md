* M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 2018 - 2020
* Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 2018 - present

Work experience
======
* Summer 2022: Interim Engineering Intern at Qualcomm, CA, USA
  * Studied Qualcomm Research's project on multi-vendor training for cross-node ML based CSI feedback
  * Proposed the training methodologies to prove that heterogeneous neural network models from multiple UE vendors can train together with a gNB vendor
  * Implemented the algorithms in PyTorch to show they achieve near optimal performance and interoperability during inference

* Spring 2021: Machine Learning Research Intern at Toyota InfoTechnology Lab, CA, USA
  * Designed the federated learning framework for the object detection task on vehicle cameras
  * Proposed the algorithm that addresses the client heterogeneity in local data and computation resource and achieved communication and computation efficiency
  * Implemented the algorithm in Tensorflow and justified that the algorithm reaches 88 accuracy while reducing 35% communication cost and 66% training time
