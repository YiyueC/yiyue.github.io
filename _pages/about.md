My name is Yiyue Chen (陈祎玥) and I obtained my PhD degree at The University of Texas at Austin. My academic track is Decision, Information, and Communications Engineering (DICE) in Electrical and Computer Engineering department and I am part of the Wireless Networking and Communications Group (WNCG). I am fortunate to be supervised by Dr. Haris Vikalo. I received my MSE degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering deparment at UT Austin in 2020 and BS degree in Applied Mathematics from Wuhan University in 2018.

Research Interests
======
My research interests include distributed optimization, large-scale machine learning and self-supervised learning under resource constraints. I am passionate about developing and understanding machine learning/deep learning algorithms for real world challenges. In particular, my focus is on learning over dynamic networks and heterogeneous-resource agents. When the network is directed and time-varying, I have designed, implemented and analyzed efficient distributed optimization algorithms. In dealing with the resource-heterogeneous clients, I have proposed a unique algorithm that can address multiple resource heterogeneities with both theoretical and experimental demonstration. Moreover, I have extensive industry experience on researching and establishing AI-based solutions to practical problems.
